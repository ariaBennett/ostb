The Open Source Textbooks Platform will Allow Educators to Collaborate and Create Interactive Textbooks

Open Source Textbooks is a version-controlled textbook writing platform with collaborative real-time editing. It is also easy to create interactive elements that will enhance the reader’s experience. Interactions can range in complexity from a multiple choice question to a manipulable sine wave generator.

The current textbook publishing model is exploitive broken. Students are forced to pay high prices for textbooks with only minor changes as publishers seek to maximize revenues and stamp out used books. Furthermore, books as an instructional medium are outdated – a website can offer everything a book can, and far more. 

Open Source Textbooks make it easy to publish and maintain an interactive textbook fit for the internet age. It also shifts control over teaching material away from publishers, and puts it back into the hands of educators.

“We are applying technology to a broken education system in desperate need of an overhaul. Its past time we started using technology to make knowledge available to more people instead of less.” - Alejandro Sanchez
